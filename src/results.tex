\caption{Performance of the algorithms with the data set ALL-AML discretized with equal frequency.
The suffix `1T' attached to RS and DFS indicates that only one hypergraph was processed a time (the
sequential version); no suffix indicates 8 hypergraphs were processed a time (parallel version).
Numbers on the right-hand side y-axis indicate the number of bins used to discretize the data.}

The suffix `1T' attached to RS and DFS indicates that only one hypergraph was processed a time (the
sequential version); no suffix indicates 8 hypergraphs were processed a time (parallel version).
Numbers on the right-hand side y-axis indicate the number of bins used to discretize the data.}
